Reinforcement Learning solution of the [OpenAI's Gym Environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs).


## About

[OpenAI-Gym](https://gym.openai.com) is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

This repository consists of the reinforcement learning solutions using different algorithms for various OpenAI-Gym environments.

## Algorithms tried so far

- Basic neural networks with state as input and actions as output
- Q-table lookup with (state, action) pairs
- DQN

## Contributing
Open to `enhancements` & `bug-fixes`

## Note
The project was made just to try out the OpenAI Gym and I hope to solve many more OpenAI Gym Environments.
